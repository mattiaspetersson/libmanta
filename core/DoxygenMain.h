 * \section introduction Introduction
 * 
 * libmanta is a cross-platform API for the Snyderphonics Manta control
 * surface. The low-level USB communication uses hidapi to communicate with the
 * Manta, and provides a way to subscribe to the different events the Manta can
 * generate, as well as methods to set the LEDs.
 *
 * \section api_usage API Usage
 *
 * The main interface to libManta is through the Manta class. This class is not
 * meant to be instantiated directly, but should be subclassed by your
 * application. The Manta class provides implementations for all the SetLED
 * methods, and declares virtual methods for all the different events that can
 * be generated by the Manta. Your subclass should implement which ever event
 * methods that are required by your application.
 *
 * The Manta class it itself a subclass of MantaUSB, which provides an
 * interface for connecting, disconnecting, querying the serial number, and
 * writing raw LED control frames. It also provides a method called
 * HandleEvents(), which services all of the USB communication. Your
 * application is responsible for calling HandleEvents() periodically (every
 * 2-6ms) to ensure that messages are passed to and from the Manta.
 *
 * \section build Building libmanta
 *
 * To include libmanta in your application, simply add the following files
 * to your build system to link them into your application.
 * \li Manta.cpp
 * \li MantaUSB.cpp
